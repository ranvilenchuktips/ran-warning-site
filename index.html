  <h2>Allegations Against Ran Vilenchuk</h2>
  <p>Ran Vilenchuk promoted houses in Detroit as fully renovated and occupied by rent-paying tenants. However, many investors discovered the homes were vacant, severely damaged, or even uninhabitable. His business partner, Sean Tissue (also known as Sean Ryan), was later <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edmi/pr/real-estate-investor-sentenced-3-million-wire-and-bankruptcy-fraud-scheme" target="_blank">convicted of wire fraud in the U.S.</a></p>

  <p><strong>According to court documents, Tissue orchestrated a substantial real estate investment fraud scheme from approximately 2015 through 2021. Tissue and those working with him made numerous fraudulent representations to potential investors from Israel.</strong></p>

  <p><strong>According to a U.S. criminal complaint</strong>, Ran Vilenchuk used an email address at the domain <strong>@rentvestor.com</strong>, which was associated with Sean Tissue’s fraudulent real estate activities. This connection is documented in a U.S. District Court filing. Ran used the title “Business Local Partner, Israel” and directly emailed Israeli investors on behalf of Centureon.</p>
