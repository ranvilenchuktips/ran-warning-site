  <p>Ran Vilenchuk is known to have been associated with Centureon Investments, a Detroit-based real estate company that marketed investment properties to international buyers. He was involved as the Israeli representative and local sales and management contact, introducing himself as “Business Local Partner, Israel”.</p>

  <h2>Allegations Against Ran Vilenchuk</h2>
  <p>Ran Vilenchuk promoted houses in Detroit as fully renovated and occupied by rent-paying tenants. However, many investors discovered the homes were vacant, severely damaged, or even uninhabitable. His business partner, Sean Tissue (also known as Sean Ryan), was later <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edmi/pr/real-estate-investor-sentenced-3-million-wire-and-bankruptcy-fraud-scheme" target="_blank">convicted of wire fraud in the U.S.</a></p>

  <p><strong>According to court documents, Tissue orchestrated a substantial real estate investment fraud scheme from approximately 2015 through 2021. Tissue and those working with him made numerous fraudulent representations to potential investors from Israel.</strong></p>

  <p>This case is further supported by evidence from a <strong>criminal complaint filed in the U.S. District Court</strong>. According to that complaint, an individual using an email with the domain <strong>@rentvestor.com</strong> and a signature identifying himself as the “Business Local Partner, Israel” for CENTUREON was involved in directly instructing Israeli investors to wire over $600,000. The domain was associated with Sean Tissue’s operation, and this email identity strongly points to Ran Vilenchuk.</p>
